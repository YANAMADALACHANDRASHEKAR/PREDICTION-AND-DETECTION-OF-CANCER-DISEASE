# PREDICTION-AND-DETECTION-OF-CANCER-DISEASE
My Academic Project



Machine learning is used in almost all the medical fields by the diagnostics and doctors
especially in predicting and detecting the risk of cancer. This growing trend of machine
learning utilization in this approach enables the researchers to survey on the various types
and approaches of machine learning . Machine learning is increasingly being employed
in cancer detection and diagnosis. Cancer prediction will become quite easy in the future
and we can predict it without the need of going to the hospitals. As we can see many
technologies are being used and tested in the medical field. So, by this we can say that
this will make us easier in the future to detect cancer.
